# JavaScript Development Final Project - Free Games 2 Play Web App
Welcome to the README file for the Free Games 2 Play web app, a project developed as part of the JavaScript Development course. This web application utilizes the power of Axios to fetch data from the 'freetogame.com' API, allowing users to search for game information using various filters such as game tags, keywords, platforms, and genres. Additionally, users can manage their favourite games by adding/removing them and conveniently store these favorites using the browser's localStorage feature.

# Project Overview
The Free Games 2 Play web app is designed to showcase the skills acquired during the JavaScript Development course and prior knowledge in HTML/CSS. It is built using modern JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS. It uses Axios JavaScript library to interact with the 'freetogame.com' API. Users can search for game information based on various criteria and keep track of their favourite games using the localStorage feature. The app provides a practical demonstration of working with APIs, handling user interactions, and managing data persistence. It uses a third party proxy server to do AJAX requests to the API. If the search results failed to load, go to https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/corsdemo to request temporary access to the demo server.

# Features:
- Game Search: Users can search for games using tags, platforms, genres, and other filters.
